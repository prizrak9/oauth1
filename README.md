# Keycloak test

## Overview
Had to be a carrier one but failed.
Keycloak's been connected and login- logout functions implemented. 
However, admin api seems to be unreachable, hence failure.
There was a framework for working with keycloak named Owin but it died long ago.
All the functionality implemented via basic OAuth built-in libraries.
